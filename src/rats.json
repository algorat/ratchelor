But I’ll get to that later.",

Well, I don’t usually tell people this unless they’re my close friends, but my great-great-uncle actually single-handedly brought the plague from France to Italy.

At first I was just like all the other rats, but one day I ate a bit of candy on the street and my body changed all at once! My siblings would make fun of me for my new appearance, and I was so ashamed. I learned that humans wear clothes, so I started wearing them too to hide myself. But I think I’m ready to show you all of myself.",
            "I’m so glad you kept me around… I thought for sure I had scared you away. I feel like you really get me. I usually feel so lonely in my day to day life as a consultant for movies. I never had a connection with someone like this before.",

It’s not only a chemical reaction in my brain, it’s much more than that, words cannot describe. My love, I am going to dedicate my black plague documentary to you!"

My mom took care of me and it grew right back. That’s what I’m looking for in a partner… someone who will be there for me when I need them.",

Ever since I was a little rat I’ve felt different from everyone else. I don’t know. I don’t know what I’m doing here. You’re so attractive and I’m just… me. And the other rats have so much to offer. It feels like I’m in high school again.",

We’re also sorry that we lied about our job, but we just wanted to impress you so much. But when we saw your picture, we just knew we had to meet you. We fell in love instantly. And after getting to know you more, we’ve fallen even more in love. We love you so much."
