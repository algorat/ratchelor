A basic app :)

# Running the app

Requirements: Either yarn or npm

Important note: We use firebase to see who is the most popular rat (its egg salad <3) it is not necessary for ratchelor to function, but you need to take it out because if you run ratchelor without some firebase credentials in an .env file in the base directory you will get a “missing projectID” error. 
**If you want to run the app** In the `src` folder we have included a version of `App.js` with the firebase stuff taken out, it is called `App_sans_firebase.js` you can rename that file `App.js` after deleting the existing `App.js`.
